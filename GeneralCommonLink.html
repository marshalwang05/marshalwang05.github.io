<h1><center>Poverty in Sustainable Cities</center></h1>

<p>Sustainable Cities are the ideal what every city wishes to be, but what about the poverty rate there? Despite all the technological innovation that can be seen in such cities, there is still the massive problem with poverty. For isntance, in Singapore, which is widely regarded as one of the forerunners of green cities, is around 30% while the population under the absolute poverty line is 11.8%. This is an incredibly high number for such a developed country. The main thing to be noticed from this is that no matter how important the enviroment, at the end of the day human lives also matter and before building such great cities, these factors should be considered. With that, this does not take into account of other such cities mentioned in the previous page, however considering many non-green cities still have lower poverty rates, we should strive to focus on that aspect first.</span></p>
